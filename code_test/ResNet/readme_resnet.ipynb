    "If one hypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate complicated functions, then it is equivalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approximate the residual functions, i.e., $\\mathcal{H}(x)-x$ (assuming that the input and output are of the same dimensions). So rather than expect stacked layers to approximate H(x), we explicitly let these layers approximate a residual function $\\mathcal{F}(x) := \\mathcal{H}(x) - x$.\n",

    "With the residual learning reformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers may simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear layers toward zero to approach identity mappings.\n",
